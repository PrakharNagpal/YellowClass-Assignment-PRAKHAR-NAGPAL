## About the Project :thought_balloon:

This app has been made for Yellow Class to save their recorded lectures in a single playlist and help the students see their recorded lectures anywhere and anytime.
  
This app has an infinite scrolling list of cards where by default the card will display an image. If the user stops scrolling, then only the first card in the viewport will start playing a video. The video should only play while the card is visible on the screen and should stop as soon as it moves out of the viewport.

 It uses Standard Video_Player library.
